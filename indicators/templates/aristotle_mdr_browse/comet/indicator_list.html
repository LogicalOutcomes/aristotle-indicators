        <h2>How to find indicators</h2>
        <p>
        This site is a prototype indicator registry, sponsored by LogicalOutcomes and based on the open source Aristotle metadata registry.
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently, the registry contains mainly financial literacy indicators sponsored by Prosper Canada. See About for a description of the project and our approach to selecting indicators.
        </p>
        <p>
        To explore indicators, select options in the left menu. You can narrow down by topic or type; as the registry grows you will see more search facets.
        </p>
        <p>
        Click on the indicator name to see the details, or select up to three indicators to compare them.
